## Fitness & Running

{% imageRt "syracuse_half.jpg", "After the Syracuse Half Marathon" %} 

I am super into running! In May 2020, I ran my first marathon. Our family had planned to race in the Mountains 2 Beach Marathon. However, it was cancelled due to COVID-19. We still ended up doing the race though. We routed out a fun course around Trumansburg and Ithaca! It was a great day! I was super proud to finish. You can [follow my running adventures on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12539170).

I also work at [Finger Lakes Running Company](https://www.fingerlakesrunningco.com/). This job is amazing! I get to meet tons of amazing people, and help them find shoes and other running gear! There is such a satisfaction that I get from helping others along their fitness journeys. 

In addition to running, I also practice Seido Karate! Our school offers Seido Karate instead of Physical Education. I’m super glad that I enrolled! I’ve gotten to learn about Japanese culture, physical wellness, and about the origins of Karate! I’ve also been able to learn some pretty sweet moves!

## Acting

I love acting. The first show that I acted in was a musical titled Joust! Once I started the show, I realized how much I liked to act. I kept performing in musicals and plays and had a great time with it! 

In 2014, I was cast in my first non-school role, Oliver in [Encore Players Community Theatre's production of Oliver!](https://encoreplayers.org/past-productions/oliver).

I also enjoy participating in shows in other ways. In Summer 2019, I played in the pit orchestra for Encore Players' Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It was then that I realized how fun it was to be a musician in a musical! Since then, I have been able to act and play in multiple shows. I can’t wait to play and act in more musicals and plays.

## School

{% imageRt "school.jpg", "My first day of school, a long time ago!" %} 

I enjoy learning in school, but also getting to spend time with my friends. I'm a junior at Charles O. Dickerson High School. I am especially fond of all the music courses that our school offers. I am taking AP Music Theory this year, and am having a great time! I am also a member of our school concert band, jazz band, mixed choir, and vocal jazz ensemble. I am super lucky that our school offers so many musical opportunities. I’ve also been studying Spanish for four years. I think that the language is super intuitive, and flows nicely in conversation.
