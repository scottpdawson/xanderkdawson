## Fitness & Running

{% imageRt "marathon_completed.jpg", "After my first marathon!" %} 

I am super into running! In May 2020, I ran my first marathon. Our family had planned to race in the Mountains 2 Beach Marathon. However, it was cancelled due to COVID-19. We still ended up doing the race though. We routed out a fun course around Trumansburg and Ithaca! It was a great day! I was super proud to finish. You can [follow my running adventures on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12539170).

I also work at [Finger Lakes Running Company](https://www.fingerlakesrunningco.com/). This job is amazing! I get to meet tons of amazing people, and help them find shoes and other running gear! There is such a satisfaction that I get from helping others along their fitness journeys. 

In addition to running, I also practice Seido Karate! Our school offers Seido Karate instead of Physical Education. I’m super glad that I enrolled! I’ve gotten to learn about Japanese culture, physical wellness, and about the origins of Karate! I’ve also been able to learn some pretty sweet moves!
