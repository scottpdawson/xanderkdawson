## Score Preparation & Transcription

Does this sound like you? You just added the final touches to your musical project, but the score looks clunky and hard-to-read. I will work with you to create a clean, professional-looking score. I've done score preparation, most notably for the Berklee Musical Theatre Club, the Berklee Broadway Band, and the album [Put the Q in Jazz](https://muz4now.com/2022/jazz-quintet-release-put-the-q-in-jazz/). I will also transcribe classical, jazz, and anything in between. Contact me for rates and more details.

## Scoring

Do you have a film that needs that extra dimension? I'll work with you to create a score that fits the emotion of your video. Check out the score to [Next Flight Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfeoLomVH_M) which was recognized as a finalist in the Indie Film Music Competition. Contact me for rates and more details.
