## Meet My Instruments

I love to name my instruments (no, I’m not crazy). I feel like each instrument has its own personality! Therefore, each instrument deserves its own name. Here are the names of my instruments:

### Claudia

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Instrument</th>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Saxophone</td>
    <td>Yamaha YAS-62</td>
    <td>Claudia</td>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% imageRt "saxophone.jpg", "Saxophone" %}

I really enjoy this Yamaha YAS-62! I bought it during my freshman year of high school, and have really enjoyed playing it. I play with the Vandoren Optimum mouthpiece (AL3), and with a Silverstein Titanium ligature (Generation 5).

    <p>This was my submission for the New York State School of Music Festival 2021. I played the second and third movement of the Heiden Sonata for Alto Saxophone.

    <p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to play this virtually with MSgt Jeremy P. Koch of the United States Air Force Bands as part of the USAFB Duet Initiative.</p>

### Felix

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Instrument</th>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Flute</td>
    <td>Yamaha 462</td>
    <td>Felix</td>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% imageRt "flute_playing.jpg", "Flute" %}

At the end of 2019, I was looking to get my own flute. I had been playing on a school issued flute for about a year and a half, and decided that I wanted to have an instrument that I could call my own. I went to Atlas Music where I was able to try out a ton of different flutes. On the car ride home, I decided that Felix would be the perfect name for my flute! I love exploring flute technique and repertoire during my practice sessions on this flute.

### Clari

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Instrument</th>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Clarinet</td>
    <td>Buffet B12</td>
    <td>Clari</td>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% imageRt "clarinet.jpg", "Clarinet" %}

My clarinet is a Buffet B12. I love the timbre of the clarinet, and how it produces its tone. I have been fortunate to be able to gig on the clarinet through pit orchestras and ensembles. I had the privilege to play in New York’s Area All-State Festival on the clarinet.

### Sforzando

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Instrument</th>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Piano</td>
    <td>1941 Steinway Model S</td>
    <td>Sforzando</td>
  </tbody>
</table>

I learned to play piano on an upright we had borrowed from my grandparents. In 2016, my parents bought a [1941 Steinway Model S](https://www.steinway.com/pianos/steinway/grand/model-s).
