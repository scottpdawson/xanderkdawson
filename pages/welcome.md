<blockquote><i>“The sax playing is the stand-out on this track, balanced pushy harsh notes along with the most delicate of touches. The sax soars away with the melody in a raspy, improvised, tonal reflection of the original theme, almost delicate in its note placement. A gorgeous sax-led section adds variation and reflection.”</i><br />— Sammy Stein, <i>United Kingdom</i>, Jazz Views Reviews</blockquote>
