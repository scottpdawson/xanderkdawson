## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Xander Dawson.

{% imageRt "xander_lugano.jpg", "On vacation in Lugano" %} 

Iâ€™m an aspiring woodwind doubler, pianist, and vocalist currently in high school. I love playing music, and I love exploring new repertoire. I also love to run, act, and ski. I live in the town of Trumansburg, New York. Iâ€™m lucky to live in such a great region! There are some great trails and some amazing people. However, I hope to move to a metropolitan setting when I am older.

I work at [Finger Lakes Running Company](https://www.fingerlakesrunningco.com/). I get to meet a ton of amazing people. I help people find running shoes and running gear to match their needs and their preferences. It is a great job and has taught me a lot about running! 

One of my favorite things to do is spend time with my pet rabbit, [Phoebe](https://www.instagram.com/phoebe.the.bunny/)! We adopted her in 2019 from the [SPCA of Tompkins County](http://spcaonline.com/). She has been a great addition to our family! 

I hope that this website helps you to learn more about me. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
