        <p>My flute is a Yamaha 462. At the end of 2019, I was looking to get my own flute. I had been playing on a school issued flute for about a year and a half, and decided that I wanted to have an instrument that I could call my own. I went to Atlas Music where I was able to try out a ton of different flutes. On the car ride home, I decided that Felix would be the perfect name for my flute! I love exploring flute technique and repertoire during my practice sessions on this flute.</p>
